    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm Chikondi Dula, a passionate community development practitioner and an aspiring full-stack software developer. With a background in Fisheries Science and over four years of experience implementing communities development projects in Malawi and Rwanda. Through my work experience i have witnessed rural inhabitants missing or having limited access opportunities or knowledge that can improve their livelihoods.</p>
    <p>This experience ignited the desire in me to solve real-world problems especially those affecting rural communities through technology. I joined the Power Learn Project to gain the technical skills needed to build digital solutions, such as web-based platforms that can support small-scale fish farmers, enhance market access, and improve service delivery in community development.</p>
    <p>I believe in combining field experience with innovation to create impact-driven solutions.</p>

    <h2>Interests</h2>
  <p>
    I'm excited about the power of technology to create practical, life-changing solutions—especially for underserved communities. 
    My main interests lie in <strong>full-stack web development</strong>, <strong>digital tools for agriculture and fisheries</strong>, 
    and <strong>community-based tech innovation</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm passionate about building platforms that improve access to markets, information, and services—particularly for small-scale 
    farmers, youth, and marginalized groups. I also enjoy exploring how data and software can support evidence-based decision-making 
    in community development.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I continue growing in software development, I’m especially drawn to projects that combine 
    <strong>social impact with technology</strong>, turning challenges into digital opportunities.
